# DUStudyLink

## Project Overview
*This is the project page for our seventh-semester web application development project at CSEDU, we extended our previous work on Salvare to give it a more finalized form. The following documentation is required for the completion of the project.*

DUStudyLink is a web application, powered by the Firebase FireStore Database. It helps users effortlessly save, organize, and share a variety of online resources, including links, articles, images, and videos. Designed with students in mind, DUStudyLink addresses the critical challenges of managing and accessing valuable course-related content in an age of information overload.

## Project Rationale

### Background
With the surge in online activity, individuals often struggle to keep track of the vast amount of information available. Key challenges faced by users include:
- Losing access to previously encountered online content.
- Inefficient search tools that fail to locate specific saved resources.
- A lack of accessible organizational features, such as tags, for better content categorization.
- Difficulties in saving multiple links simultaneously.
- Challenges in sharing resources without relying on messaging platforms.

DUStudyLink aims to provide a unified solution for saving and accessing online content while integrating collaborative features that facilitate easier resource sharing among peers. The application particularly focuses on enhancing the learning experience by enabling students to share resources for their courses effectively.

### Scope
The concept of an "online basket" for gathering resources is not new, but existing implementations often fall short. DUStudyLink seeks to enhance the user experience by introducing features that significantly improve productivity for both casual and power users. Key offerings include:
- Regex-based search for advanced filtering.
- Tagging and batch link addition capabilities.
- Collaborative baskets specifically designed for sharing course-related resources among peers.

By focusing on user-friendliness and accessibility, DUStudyLink aims to cater to a broad audience while maintaining functionality for advanced users.

## Project Objectives
- **Develop a Central Dashboard:** Create a user-friendly web interface that serves as the hub for saving and viewing content.
- **Enable Multi-User Support:** Allow multiple users to collaborate within the same application instance, managing authorizations for resource sharing.
- **Implement Advanced Filtering:** Provide users with powerful filtering options, including regex matching, content type, date range, domains, and tags.
- **Facilitate Bulk Link Parsing:** Enable the extraction of multiple links from a single text input.
- **Generate User Insights:** Offer statistical insights regarding the user's saved content and sharing activity.
- **Support Course Resource Sharing:** Develop features that allow users to share resources specifically related to their courses, enhancing collaborative learning.
